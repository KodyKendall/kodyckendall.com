<p><strong>Who Reads and Writes Anymore?</strong></p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/23/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">Pew Research Center</a>, 26% of American adults say that they haven't read -- even just parts -- of a book in the last year. That's more than 1 in 4 Americans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredmeyer/2016/06/27/american-voters-are-ignorant-but-not-stupid/#162fa1da7ff1">Only 34% of Americans</a>&nbsp;can name all three branches of the federal government, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haveninsights.com/just-37-percent-name-representative/">only 37%&nbsp;</a>can name their congressional representatives. How can the people of a country be empowered if they don't even understand the basic functioning of their government?</p>
<p>Reading and writing are important. Reading is how we come to learn from people's past mistakes, and how we come to grow and learn as individuals and as a society, while writing is how information is shared and refined. It's much easier to critique bad ideas when they're written down, which is why writing frequently can improve critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>Even though I'm only 21 years old, I try to read and write as much as possible to learn from those who have gone before me, and to pass on anything I learn along the way. I'm the true recipient of benefits from this blog, but If I can pass on even a little bit of knowledge, wisdom, or appreciation to someone along the way, that's good too.</p>
<p>And to be honest, what other hobbies are there for a 21 year old to pursue? Sure, you could be like everybody else and spend your time watching football, playing computer games, watching Netflix, and browsing Reddit. But where would that take you in 5 years?</p>
<p><strong>What Activities Done Today, Lead to Fulfillment Tomorrow?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not necessarily against these things, I just don&rsquo;t think these things necessarily give people the best lives they can live. While they&rsquo;re fun and enjoyable in the moment, over the course of a lifetime, I don&rsquo;t think most people would actually find these things fulfilling.</p>
<p>Do you imagine that on your deathbed, you&rsquo;d ever look back and think: &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m so glad I never missed a Denver Broncos football game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, &ldquo;Man, I put in three hours of Halo every evening. I&rsquo;m so happy I unlocked the Master Chief edition helmet and got it gilded with all my bonus points. That was the best moment of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you think that you would look back on your life and be happy with those things, then by all means let those be your hobbies. And people who choose to live their life that way shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be disparaged, as mostly all looking for the same thing: happiness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end. The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, it is the same desire in both, attended with different views. The will never takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- Blaise Pascal, <strong><em>Pens&eacute;es</em></strong></p>
<p>But for me, happiness means long-term fulfillment, and not just short-term distraction. I think fulfillment comes readily to those who spend time cultivating skills that will serve them best in the future &ndash; and for me, thinking and writing is both enjoyable and useful.</p>
<p>If you think so too maybe you should start a blog, or at the very least a journal.</p>
